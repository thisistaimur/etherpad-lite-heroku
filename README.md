# About
Etherpad is a real-time collaborative editor scalable to thousands of simultaneous real time users. It provides full data export capabilities, and runs on _your_ server, under _your_ control.

As the project has Etherpad as submodule, you need to clone it with `--recursive` flag:


`git clone --recursive https://github.com/citizenos/etherpad-lite-heroku.git`

### Configuration

Configuration can be specified in 2 ways:

* File (`config/local.json`) - designed for development environments where file configuration is simpler to maintain than env variables. See the example [local.json](config/local.json.example)
* Environment variables - this is where all Heroku configuration variables show up.
=======
## Requirements
- `nodejs` >= **10.13.0**.

## GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like systems

### Quick install on Debian/Ubuntu
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
git clone --branch master https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git && cd etherpad-lite && bin/run.sh
```

### Manual install
You'll need git and [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed (minimum required Node version: **10.13.0**).

**As any user (we recommend creating a separate user called etherpad):**

1. Move to a folder where you want to install Etherpad. Clone the git repository: `git clone --branch master git://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git`
2. Change into the new directory containing the cloned source code: `cd etherpad-lite`
3. run `bin/run.sh` and open <http://127.0.0.1:9001> in your browser.

To update to the latest released version, execute `git pull origin`. The next start with `bin/run.sh` will update the dependencies.

[Next steps](#next-steps).

## Windows

### Prebuilt Windows package
This package runs on any Windows machine, but for development purposes, please do a manual install.

1. [Download the latest Windows package](https://etherpad.org/#download)
2. Extract the folder

Run `start.bat` and open <http://localhost:9001> in your browser. You like it? [Next steps](#next-steps).

### Manually install on Windows
You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and (optionally, though recommended) git.

1. Grab the source, either
  - download <https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/zipball/master>
  - or `git clone --branch master https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git`
2. With a "Run as administrator" command prompt execute `bin\installOnWindows.bat`

**NOTE:** Environment variables override `config/local.json`.

#### Etherpad-Lite configuration variables 

In Heroku config variables (ENV):

* `ETHERPAD_SETTINGS` - JSON string of the whole standard Etherpad-Lite `settings.json`.
* `ETHERPAD_SESSION_KEY` - The secret stored in Etherpad-Lite `SESSIONKEY.txt`.
* `ETHERPAD_API_KEY` - The secret stored in Etherpad-Lite `APIKEY.txt`.
* `DATABASE_URL` - Default database URI environment variable set by Heroku. It overrides all other DB configurations.

<<<<<<< HEAD
JSON defined in `ETHERPAD_SETTINGS` or `config/local.json`:

* `___apiKey` - The secret stored in Etherpad-Lite `APIKEY.txt`.
* `___sessionKey` - The secret stored in Etherpad-Lite `SESSIONKEY.txt`.
* `___version` - Per plugin configuration. Version of plugin to be installed by NPM.

#### Plugin configuration
=======
## Docker container

Find [here](doc/docker.md) information on running Etherpad in a container.

# Next Steps

## Tweak the settings
You can modify the settings in `settings.json`.
If you need to handle multiple settings files, you can pass the path to a settings file to `bin/run.sh` using the `-s|--settings` option: this allows you to run multiple Etherpad instances from the same installation.
Similarly, `--credentials` can be used to give a settings override file, `--apikey` to give a different APIKEY.txt file and `--sessionkey` to give a non-default SESSIONKEY.txt.
**Each configuration parameter can also be set via an environment variable**, using the syntax `"${ENV_VAR}"` or `"${ENV_VAR:default_value}"`. For details, refer to `settings.json.template`.
Once you have access to your `/admin` section settings can be modified through the web browser.

If you are planning to use Etherpad in a production environment, you should use a dedicated database such as `mysql`, since the `dirtyDB` database driver is only for testing and/or development purposes.

Plugin version and configuration can be specified. Plugins are configured as you would normally do in Etherpad-Lite `settings.json`, but you can also specify plugin version which will be installed by NPM.

* `___version` - version of the plugin to be installed.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Example plugin config in `ETHERPAD_SETTINGS` or `config/local.json`:

```
  "ep_themes_ext": {
    "___version": "0.0.4",
    "default": [
      "https://dev.citizenos.com:3001/static/styles/etherpad.css"
    ]
  }
```
#### Etherpad-Lite Heroku specific conf

* `ETHERPAD_LITE_HEROKU_LOGGER_LEVEL` - Logging level for the [start.js](start.js) script.

### Run

#### Heroku

## Customize functionalities with plugins

![Basic install](doc/images/etherpad_basic.png "Basic Installation")

![Full Features](doc/images/etherpad_full_features.png "You can add a lot of plugins !")

Etherpad is very customizable through plugins. Instructions for installing themes and plugins can be found in [the plugin wiki article](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/Available-Plugins).

## Customize the style with skin variants

Open <http://127.0.0.1:9001/p/test#skinvariantsbuilder> in your browser and start playing !

The [wiki](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki) is your one-stop resource for Tutorials and How-to's.

Documentation can be found in `doc/`.

# Development

## Things you should know
You can debug Etherpad using `bin/debugRun.sh`.

You can run Etherpad quickly launching `bin/fastRun.sh`. It's convenient for developers and advanced users. Be aware that it will skip the dependencies update, so remember to run `bin/installDeps.sh` after installing a new dependency or upgrading version.

If you want to find out how Etherpad's `Easysync` works (the library that makes it really realtime), start with this [PDF](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/raw/master/doc/easysync/easysync-full-description.pdf) (complex, but worth reading).

## Contributing
Read our [**Developer Guidelines**](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

# Get in touch
The official channel for contacting the development team is via the [Github issues](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues).

For **responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities**, please write a mail to the maintainer (a.mux@inwind.it).

# HTTP API
Etherpad is designed to be easily embeddable and provides a [HTTP API](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/HTTP-API)
that allows your web application to manage pads, users and groups. It is recommended to use the [available client implementations](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/HTTP-API-client-libraries) in order to interact with this API.

OpenAPI (previously swagger) definitions for the API are exposed under `/api/openapi.json`.

# jQuery plugin
There is a [jQuery plugin](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite-jquery-plugin) that helps you to embed Pads into your website.

# Plugin Framework
Etherpad offers a plugin framework, allowing you to easily add your own features. By default your Etherpad is extremely light-weight and it's up to you to customize your experience. Once you have Etherpad installed you should visit the plugin page and take control.

Push it to your Heroku and Heroku will just run it picking up the entry point from [Procfile](Procfile)

#### Locally

<<<<<<< HEAD
* `npm run start-dev`

**NOTE:** When running locally with Citizen OS API, you may run into issues with certificate chain validation because of the API calls. In that case for **DEV ONLY** you can turn off the validation starting the app `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 npm run start-dev`.
**NOTE2:** DO NOT commit the generated `package.json`. If generated plugin configuration is in the `package.json` `/config/` has no effect.
